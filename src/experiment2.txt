The modified bot is not much better then the vanilla bot. By testing the 3 changes
we made separately, we found that the changes to the "won" variable did noticably
increase win rate, while the changes to rollout() actually decreased it. The changes 
think() had a small positive effect, but that could be due to chance. See README for 
a list of changes. The changes in node level do not seem have too much of an effect on 
which bot has a higher win rate, but the lower it gets the more likely ties are, 
which makes sense, since the bots have less information to use,a nd will therefore 
have a worse strategy.
