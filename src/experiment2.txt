The modified bot is not much better then the vanilla bot. By testing the 3 changes
we made separately, we found that the changes to the "won" variable did noticeably
increase win rate, while the changes to rollout() actually decreased it. The changes
think() had a small positive effect, but that could be due to chance. See README for
a list of changes. The changes in node level do not seem have too much of an effect on
which bot has a higher win rate, but the lower it gets the more likely ties are,
which makes sense, since the bots have less information to use, and will therefore
have a worse strategy. In rare cases, however, modified bot proved to be significantly
better than vanilla bot, particularly when testing with 500 nodes per tree. However,
this seems to be an outlier when compared to the rest of the tests.
